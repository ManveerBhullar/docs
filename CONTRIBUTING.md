This branch contains the source for the *Cookbook* section of docs.min.io

This content is largely unmaintained and is marked for deprecation.

Some content may be migrated to the next generation documentation at 
http://docs.min.io/minio/baremetal, http://docs.min.io/minio/k8s, or 
http://docs.min.io/minio/vsphere


If you open a pull request against this branch, please be aware that it may
go unmerged, as we do not have resources to test and validate the contents.
